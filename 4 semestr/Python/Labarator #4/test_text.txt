The majority of Americans live in or near large cities, but small living-towns are still widespread. A suburb (a small community near a big city) offers the advantages of a safer, more intimate small-town life with the recreational and cultural activities of the big city nearby. For the typical American family, a house may be at different places every five or six years. Most moves are related to new job opportunities, but sometimes the American pioneering spirit and desire for adventure inspire the moves.
About two-thirds of Americans live in houses or apartments they own. But many people rent their living quarters. Some high-rise apartments are very expensive and elegant, but many are built for moderate or even low-income families. Many apartment buildings are condominiums or cooperative apartments, which means that each family owns the unit it lives in.
More than 10 million Americans live in mobile The homes, living quarters built on wheels. They can be moved, but are generally brought to a site that becomes more or less permanent. Then the wheels are removed and the home is attached to the ground. Because they cost less than conventional homes, mobile homes are especially popular with young couples and retired couples with a limited income.
